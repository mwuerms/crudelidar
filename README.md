# crudelidar

create a crude version of a lidar using 2 stepper motors and a time of flight sensor VL53L1x. 

+ using an ardino nano to drive the steppers and get distance measurements
+ using a python script to display the results

## Attention Arduino

1. It seems that Arduino IDE wants *.cpp files and ignores *.c files
2. Maybe when creating a new function in a *.cpp/*.h file the IDE has to be restarted
